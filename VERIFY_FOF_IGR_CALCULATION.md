# Verification: Why FOF and IGR Both Have Rank 5

## Calculation with 50% YIELD + 50% Z-SCORE

### FOF:
- **YIELD**: 7.9% → **YIELD Rank: 5** (5th highest yield)
- **Z-SCORE**: -1.18 → **Z-SCORE Rank: 8** (8th best = 8th lowest Z-score)
- **Total Score**: (5 × 0.50) + (8 × 0.50) = 2.5 + 4.0 = **6.5**

### IGR:
- **YIELD**: 16.7% → **YIELD Rank: 2** (2nd highest yield)
- **Z-SCORE**: 0.01 → **Z-SCORE Rank: 11** (11th best = 11th lowest Z-score)
- **Total Score**: (2 × 0.50) + (11 × 0.50) = 1.0 + 5.5 = **6.5**

## Why They Tie

Both FOF and IGR have **Total Score = 6.5**, which means they are **mathematically equivalent**:

- **FOF**: Average YIELD (rank 5) + Average Z-SCORE (rank 8) → 6.5
- **IGR**: Excellent YIELD (rank 2) + Poor Z-SCORE (rank 11) → 6.5

**The math balances out**: IGR's excellent YIELD compensates for its poor Z-SCORE, while FOF's average YIELD compensates for its average Z-SCORE.

## Ranking Order (50% YIELD + 50% Z-SCORE)

| CEF | Total Score | Final Rank |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| GOF | 2.0 | 1 |
| PCN | 4.0 | 2 |
| FFA | 5.5 | **3** (tied) |
| UTF | 5.5 | **3** (tied) |
| FOF | 6.5 | **5** (tied) |
| IGR | 6.5 | **5** (tied) |
| CSQ | 7.0 | 7 |
| DNP | 7.5 | 8 |
| BTO | 8.0 | 9 (tied) |
| GAB | 8.0 | 9 (tied) |
| UTG | 8.5 | 11 |
| BME | 9.0 | 12 |

## Conclusion

**FOF and IGR both have rank 5 because they both have Total Score 6.5.** This is mathematically correct. The ranking system correctly identifies all ties:

- **Rank 3**: FFA and UTF (both 5.5)
- **Rank 5**: FOF and IGR (both 6.5)
- **Rank 9**: BTO and GAB (both 8.0)

This is the expected behavior when using the rank-based method with tie handling.
