# How We Rank Each Metric

## Simple Answer

**We use whole numbers (integers): 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., N**

- **Rank 1** = Best
- **Rank 2** = 2nd best  
- **Rank 3** = 3rd best
- ...
- **Rank N** = Worst (where N = total number of funds)

**We do NOT use decimals.** Ranks are always whole numbers.

## How It Works

1. **Sort all funds** by the metric (highest to lowest, or lowest to highest depending on the metric)

2. **Assign rank 1** to the best fund
3. **Assign rank 2** to the 2nd best
4. **Assign rank 3** to the 3rd best
5. Continue until all funds are ranked

## Example

If we have 6 funds ranked by Yield:

| Fund | Yield | Rank |
|------|-------|------|
| ULTY  | 76.5% | 1 (best) |
| GDXY  | 60.7% | 2 |
| OARK  | 40.9% | 3 |
| YMAG  | 33.3% | 4 |
| QQQI  | 13.9% | 5 |
| SPYI  | 11.8% | 6 (worst) |

Ranks are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6** (whole numbers only)

## For Each Metric

- **YIELD**: Rank 1 = highest yield
- **DVI/Z-SCORE**: Rank 1 = lowest DVI or lowest Z-Score (best)
- **TR 3MO/6MO/12MO**: Rank 1 = highest return

All ranks are **whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)**, never decimals.
